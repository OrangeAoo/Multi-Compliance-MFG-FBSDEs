    "  Conventional numerical solvers are hard pressed to solve PA-MFG with market-clearing conditions, which may be faced with the \"curse of dimentionality\". Thus in their study <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2110.01127\" style=\"color: pink; text-decoration: underline;\"> [1]</a>, Professor Campbell and his fellows proposed an actor-critic approach to optimization, where the agents form a Nash equilibria according to the principalâ€™s penalty function, and the principal evaluates the resulting equilibria. And they applies this approach to a stylized PA problem arising in Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) markets, where agents may <i>work</i> overtime (or <i>rent</i> capacity), <i>trade</i> RECs, and <i>expand</i> their long-term capacity to navigate the market at maximum profit.\n",

    "  And beyond the origianl study, in the summer of 2024, we further complicated the topic, i.e. extending from 1-period scenario to 2-period scenarios, providing insteresting insights into how \"planning ahead\" would make a difference in the agents' performance and the markets. \n",
