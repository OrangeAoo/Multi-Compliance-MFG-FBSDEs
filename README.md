# PA-MFG-FBSDE

These are codes and results for the research conducted with Prof Campbell in the Columbia Stats Department starting in May 2024. 

First thing first, there is a research report []() summarizing the whole process and key findings. 

The main folders are organized in the following way, reflecting the baby steps we took from the scratch. 

>- 2FBSDE
>- 4FBSDE
>- 2Population
>- 2Period

Each main folder includes __codes__ of different model and/or parameter settings, a __Results__ folder containing the pdf/html visualized outputs, a __Best Models Saved__ folder containing the saved models/parameters in the forms of `.pt` files (for the sake of reproducibility), and maybe a __Wrong Results__ folder serving as back-ups. 

Universally, there is a `README.md` file under every main folder, detailing its contents and self-defined modules. Read them carefully before running codes or reviewing the results under each individual main folder.
